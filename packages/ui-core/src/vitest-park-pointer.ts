 * file and in every file that runs after it. Whatever then renders under those coordinates is
 * `:hover`ed with no test having asked for it, and `wt-button`'s hover rule dims it to
 * `--wt-opacity-hover`, which axe scores as a colour-contrast violation.
 *
 * `userEvent.unhover()` cannot do this: @vitest/browser implements it as a hover of `html > body`,
 * which parks the cursor in the MIDDLE of the page, on top of whatever is mounted there. Negative
 * coordinates are outside the viewport, so no element can be under them.
