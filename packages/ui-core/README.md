# Shared account controls

Use `@waitron/ui-core` for account-form controls in Waitron and Waitron Cloud.
It contains the button, input, card, icon, spinner, form actions and error summary,
plus theme tokens and keyboard helpers. Application authentication and validation
stay in your application.

The package is private. Registry publication is a separate release step; this
checkout builds and tests a local tarball without publishing it.

## Use a control

Import only the controls you need and apply the theme to your application root:

```ts
import "@waitron/ui-core/components/wt-input";
import { applyTokens } from "@waitron/ui-core/tokens";

applyTokens(document.querySelector<HTMLElement>("#app")!);
```

The root export registers all included controls. Lit 3 is a peer dependency;
install it in the consuming application. Packaged exports contain JavaScript and
TypeScript declarations. Theme CSS is compiled into `applyTokens`; no Vite plugin
or Waitron source alias is needed. Raw token CSS is also exported at
`@waitron/ui-core/tokens/colors.css` and `@waitron/ui-core/tokens/structure.css`.

The controls use shadow DOM and are not native form-associated elements. Listen
for `wt-change` and the action button's click; bind `submitOnEnter` at the form
boundary. Give inputs a semantic name, an autocomplete purpose and visible labels.
Use field `error` properties and `wt-form-error-summary.errors` for validation.

## Develop and verify

Waitron's existing `@waitron/ui` imports re-export these implementations, including
its existing component paths. Workspace imports resolve source, while `pnpm pack`
runs the build and switches the packed manifest to built exports.

```sh
pnpm --filter @waitron/ui-core test
pnpm --filter @waitron/ui-core test:package
```

The package test installs an actual tarball and Lit into a temporary directory,
checks declarations, builds the consumer without workspace aliases and opens it in
Chromium. It checks keyboard submission, password reveal, accessible errors,
themes, isolated component imports and a missing-file negative control. CI runs
this proof alongside both UI packages' coverage; weekly mutation tests cover both.

The tarball carries the repository's existing `LICENSE` and `LICENSE-GRANTS.md`
under `dist/`. This extraction does not change their terms.
