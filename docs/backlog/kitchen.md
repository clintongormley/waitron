# The kitchen and preparation — detail

The open entries are listed in [the backlog](../backlog.md), under "The kitchen and preparation". This file holds
their full text.

## KDS operations — low priority (A9)

Order routing is built (item→station, station→printer, receipt→printer). Gaps: a routing read-back /
audit view (the station selects are set-only — the most useful to close); no station `type`/`kind`;
single-target only (no fan-out, no per-modifier or per-time rules). Table and service statuses have
full CRUD; kitchen statuses are partial — `bump_mode` and `fire_control` are configurable fixed
enums, but a user-definable kitchen-status list does not exist.
