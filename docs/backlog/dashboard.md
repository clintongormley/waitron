# Users, sign-in and the dashboard shell — detail

The open entries are listed in [the backlog](../backlog.md), under "Users, sign-in and the dashboard shell". This file holds
their full text.

## `date-utils.test.ts` has a test titled as guarding "against a vacuous pass"

- Found by #612 (the rest of `apps/dashboard`), not fixable in a comments-only change.
  `date-utils.test.ts` has a test titled as guarding "against a vacuous pass", but #612's
  review removed the timezone pin and ran the file under `TZ=UTC`, and all four cases failed on
  their own. `catalogues` in `apps/dashboard/src/i18n/strings.ts` is read by nothing but
  `i18n/t.test.ts` (`t.ts` registers `{ en, es }` with the kit), so that test's "registers en-GB"
  case tests nothing that runs. The browser project in `apps/dashboard/vitest.config.ts` still
  excludes `.stryker-tmp`, though the app has no Stryker config. Not restored, by the review's
  choice: a note that `#sessionPermissions` only guides the screen and every module route is still
  checked on the server (not traced).

## `setEmail` in `packages/identity/src/staff.ts`, unlike `updatePersonDetails`, never checks the new email against other people's pending emails

- Identity code, found by #559: `setEmail` in `packages/identity/src/staff.ts`,
  unlike `updatePersonDetails`, never checks the new email against other people's pending
  emails; `manager-login.ts` reports an authenticator secret it cannot decrypt as a failed login
  (`password.invalid`, logged with the reason `unreadable_secret` since C95), like a wrong code.
  Identity's coverage reads 99.85 statements / 99.75 branches, not 100: the
  `management_session.required` throw in `profile.ts`'s `ownSession`, as it stands since #554,
  is reached by no test.

## Dashboard leftovers from the coverage branch

**Dashboard leftovers from the coverage branch — OPEN (found 2026-09-23, PR #538).** Each from
reading unless marked run:

- `wt-dialog` re-sends the native dialog's `close` event as `wt-close`
  (`packages/ui/src/components/wt-dialog.ts`), and the native event arrives a task after the dialog
  closes — the same mechanism the catalogue screen's nested forms guard against (#741). So a dialog
  reopened within that task is shut again: `wt-dialog`'s own close handler (`onClose`) sets its
  `open` to false, which closes the native dialog, and then the screen's handler clears its state.
  `staff-screen.ts` and `purchases-screen.ts` have no guard; their tests wait out the late close
  rather than guard it (`staff-screen.test.ts`, `purchases-screen.test.ts`). `profile-screen.ts`'s
  flag (`#closingModal`) protects the screen's mode but, we believe (by reading, not tested), not
  the dialog itself. `apps/dashboard/src/widgets/allergen-picker.ts` avoids the problem by mounting
  a fresh dialog for each open (`keyed`). Seen once under coverage load in a test (run); we believe
  a person cannot reopen it that fast; not tested.
- `login-screen.ts` checks an account link's purpose with `=== null`, so a reply with no purpose at
  all would pass; the server always sends one.
- Guards no test can reach, left uncovered rather than deleted: the canvas editor's "no draft" and
  "no selected card" guards, several `?? []` and `?? null` fallbacks in the printers, payments,
  kitchen, backup, devices, profile, extra-list and option-list files, and a
  handful in `dashboard-app.ts` and `login-screen.ts`. **Next action:** delete them with a
  receipt each, or leave them as defensive code by decision.

## A person row written from outside `packages/identity` still folds its key ASCII-only

**A person row written from outside `packages/identity` still folds its key ASCII-only — OPEN
(found 2026-09-23, task F1's review wave).** SQLite's `lower()` folds ASCII and nothing else, so the
three unique indexes on `persons` stopped refusing two staff whose names differ only in the case of
an accented letter — José García beside JOSÉ GARCÍA, on a Spanish product. The repair stores a
folded key in its own column (`packages/identity/src/fold.ts`: trim, NFC, lower, NFC) and each
index reads `case when <folded> is null then lower(<raw>) else <folded> end`. **The `case` is why
this entry exists:** a bare index on the folded column alone would put every row that did not carry
one OUTSIDE the uniqueness check, which is worse than the defect. The two real paths that create a
person are routed — `packages/provisioning/src/venue-apply.ts`'s admin insert and
`apps/server/src/mirror-session.ts` both call the exported `foldForUniqueness`. **What is left
open:** every remaining writer outside `packages/identity` is a fixture or a seed, each still
folding ASCII-only, and the column is still nullable, so nothing at the compiler stops a new writer
forgetting it. **Next action:** decide whether the column becomes mandatory — which breaks every
fixture at the compiler rather than silently — or whether a guard over the write sites is enough.

## Decisions and deliberate limits

- Left open by the owner's choice (W110, #1255, "One word for 'switched off, kept for the record'
  across the dashboard"): a Delete label can be stale, because the watcher list does not re-read on
  a watcher's Done marks nor the course list on draft lines, order lines or kitchen items, in which
  case a confirmed Delete switches the row off instead.
