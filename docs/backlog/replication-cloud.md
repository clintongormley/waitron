## A completed provision or adopt operation replayed on a later request still answers 200 without restarting and keeps the setup lock set

- Found by #657 (`apps/server` part f2: the node, identity and setup files), outside its files
  or not fixable in a comments-only change. A completed provision or adopt operation replayed on
  a later request still answers 200 without restarting and keeps the setup lock set (the Cloud
  restore's replay does restart). After a refused resend of a half-finished adopt (A50, #685),
  what the first identity leaves behind on the primary and on this node is still not measured.
  The standby's reset page does not show this server's machine id, so an operator cannot tell
  which row on the primary's Servers screen is this server's (left for the owner from A70's
  review). Removing a standby that "never finished joining" (A61, #708) reads that as
  `serving-secondary` with no `nodes` row in the primary's database, and a remote standby writes
  that row in its own database, so the check cannot see a remote standby that finished — none can
  today (`finish-adoption.ts`).
  **Still open after A63 (#712):** (i) a removed trust anchor (a machine whose key sits in the
  receiver's own `nodes` table) can still make up a key for a machine in good standing that is not
  an anchor, vouch for it, and sign as that machine — unless that machine signed the receiver's
  held chart and the chart carries the endorsement its signature verifies under, so a standby is
  not covered, nor a primary the receiver holds no chart signed by (after the former primary's own
  retirement chart, for one) (stated at `resolveSignerKey`); (ii) boot reconciliation's peer fetch
  sends no credential (`boot.ts` gives `fetchPeerMembershipDocument` only the URL) and
  `GET /management-api/membership` refuses a request without one, so in production that path
  accepts no chart today and the receiver checks above never run there (read, not run); (iii) a
  cleared machine is refused its own promotion only if its own held chart contains the clearing,
  and a standby that never finished joining never receives it; (iv) so, of these guards, only
  those that run where a chart is made or a join is served work in production today: the
  primary's join refusals (`mirror.standby_removed` for a removed or cleared id,
  `mirror.membership_full` for a full chart) and the mint's size refusals; (v) a receiver whose
  held chart predates a removal accepts the removed machine's charts until it learns of the
  removal; (vi) a joining standby sees `mirror.bundle_fetch_failed` rather than the primary's
  reason, because `apps/server/src/mirror-bundle-fetch.ts` turns every non-2xx answer into that
  code except a refused login, which it relays as `password.invalid` (C95) — this predates A63,
  and `mirror.standby_removed` has the same gap; (vii) if A61's removal ever mis-classifies a live
  standby that an operator later promotes, the old primary refuses the new primary's charts
  (`signer_removed`) and keeps selling; the refusal is logged at warn and raises no alert. No adopt
  can finish today (`finish-adoption.ts`), so no such standby exists yet.
  A56's open items (the "Reset this server" path for a half-finished adopt, #694): (2) An adopt
  saved before that change carries no proof, so the reset refuses it (`password.invalid`). (3) The
  proof shows the login the primary accepted at join time, not that the admin is still active
  there, and the one-time code is not asked again. (4) A join that failed after writing
  `trading.env` boots the trading branch, where no setup route is mounted, so this reset cannot
  reach it.
  Also open from A42's review (#674), read and not run: if `operation.complete()` throws after
  `execute` has scheduled the restart, the lock is now released while that restart is pending.
  Stale wording outside f2: "a device with no profile" in `apps/server/src/till-api.test.ts` (near
  lines 1377–1395) and `apps/till/src/till-app.test.ts` (near line 5765), though a device's
  profile column is NOT NULL; `config.ts`'s "minted once and reused" for the box certificate, which a
  restore re-issues; and `errors.ts` describing `setup.already_provisioning` as a persistent-lease
  refusal, when it mostly comes from the in-memory lock. Test titles carrying history, left
  because titles are code: "(SP-A.2 §16, device-profile §5)" in `device-session.test.ts`, and
  "(SP-1b fiscal gate)" and "(unchanged)" in `setup-api.test.ts`. Read, not run: `cookieDomainFor`
  (`device-session.ts`) lowercases the request's host but not the configured tenant domain
  (whether configuration normalises it is unchecked), and `DeviceBinding`'s `deviceProfileId` is
  typed `string | null` for a column that cannot be null.

## `docs/developers/conventions-data.md`'s `busy_timeout` receipt … should carry the date and Node version the deleted comment had

- Found by #625 (`apps/server` part e1), outside its files or not fixable in a comments-only
  change. Docs: `docs/developers/conventions-data.md`'s `busy_timeout` receipt, which
  `recovery-lock.ts` now points at, should carry the date and Node version the deleted comment had
  (2026-09-24, Node v26.7.0). Tests and code, read not run unless stated: three `adopt.test.ts`
  titles say "before any mutation", but by then the primary has reserved an identity for the
  standby and added it to its membership list (the tests assert only on the mirror's own
  database); `adoptFromPrimary` (`adopt.ts`) spreads one adoption across several transactions with
  file writes between and no commented decision (CLAUDE.md §3), so a failure partway could leave a
  stamped mirror with no break-glass verifier; the restore guard's repeated-destination check
  compares resolved path text, so two names reaching one file through a symlink may pass;
  `mirror-session.ts`'s keepalive keeps an `isNull(lastSeenAt)` arm on a `not null` column (dead,
  kept on purpose); `MirrorBundle.wireguardPublicKey` is set by no production caller and read by
  nothing outside tests; `recovery-race.test.ts`'s header has no "weaker than its name" hedge
  though CLAUDE.md describes the guard that way. Test titles #625 could not touch:
  "…even when the retired variable is set" (`backup-config.test.ts`, still sets a `postgres://`
  URL), "…without copying the obsolete media directory" (`backup-sweep.test.ts`), "(C2b Task 9)"
  (`mirror-bundle-fetch.test.ts`), "(swap S2)" (`mirror-bundle.test.ts`) and "as a file from before
  the field existed" (`recovery-state.test.ts`).

## The boot-time fetch is given only the URL … and boot never reads the `superseded` that `reconcileMembershipOnBoot` returns

- Found by #617 (`apps/server` part f1), not fixable in a comments-only change. **Still open**
  (read, not run): the boot-time fetch is given only the URL (item (ii) of **Still open after A63**
  in the #657 item above), and boot never reads the `superseded` that
  `reconcileMembershipOnBoot` returns (`apps/server/src/boot.ts`, where it is called);
  `shouldFenceRestart` (`membership-fence.ts`) has no caller outside its test (`git grep`);
  `device-api.ts`'s ticket-item advance route did not enforce the `act-as-kds` capability
  (resolved by W97, 2026-10-06: it and the kitchen-notice acknowledge route now check the
  profile's `prepare-orders` action through `assertProfileAction`); `enrol-rate-limit.ts` keeps
  one global limit whose stated reason (snitun) is gone; `provision-till.test.ts` inserts its
  tenant with `onConflictDoNothing`, so a second call's new NIF is silently kept out;
  `provision.ts` stamps the deployment in its own transaction before `applyVenue`, a split with no
  commented decision (believed to predate #617, not checked); and `setup-operation.ts` (around
  lines 128–133) may treat a lock written by a different store as a previous boot's, so a live
  process's lock could be taken over (a belief, not verified). `node-entry.test.ts` fixtures are
  still PostgreSQL-shaped (a `Failed query` wrapper, code `42703`).
  Test titles #617 could not touch: "(SP-A.2 §16, device-profile §5)" in `device-session.test.ts`;
  "since Task 7" and "this tenant's devices" in `device-api.test.ts`; "(R1 behaviour preserved)"
  in `membership-mint.test.ts`.
