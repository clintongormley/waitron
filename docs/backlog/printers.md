# Printers, the print agent and receipts — detail

The open entries are listed in [the backlog](../backlog.md), under "Printers, the print agent and receipts". This file holds
their full text.

## What the AppArmor profile (A129, #862; A134, #887) left open

- **What the AppArmor profile (A129, #862; A134, #887) left open:**
  - **`trust` is still refused.** A property write (`trust`) and `Disconnect` were measured still
    refused against the stand-in BlueZ; BlueZ's `Agent1.Release` is not allowed either; the stand-in
    never sends it, and whether a real BlueZ does is still open.
  - **Box check owed:** after `sudo bash waitron.sh install`, switch off the kernel's rate limit on
    its log first (`sudo sysctl -w kernel.printk_ratelimit=0`), which can drop refusal lines —
    image-smoke switches it off for that reason. Then `scan on` / `scan off` and a pairing from
    `docker compose exec -it print-agent bluetoothctl`, then
    `sudo journalctl -k --since '-5 min' | grep 'apparmor="DENIED"'` should print nothing for
    `waitron-print-agent`.
  - **The setup page's HTML says nothing about Bluetooth availability** — only `/status.json` and the
    log do. The page is English-only, with no language switch to carry a Spanish line.
  - **A bus policy that refused BlueZ's own calls would read as `no_controller`**: measured
    2026-09-29 on a CI runner against the stand-in BlueZ, with a profile that allowed the bus
    daemon's own messages but no message to BlueZ: `bluetoothctl --timeout 3 devices Paired` printed
    "No default controller available" and exited 0.
  - **`bluetooth scan failed` is logged on every pass** (left by A131, #915), where the agent's other
    Bluetooth failure lines are logged once while the same failure repeats, so a box with no adapter
    logs one line per pass while a discovery window is open.
  - **On the LAN the Bluetooth report is visible only before joining or while out of touch.** Once
    the agent has joined and is not out of touch, `/status.json` answers only loopback callers
    (`networkRefused`, `apps/print-agent/src/setup-page.ts`).

## Unpair can come back for a short while after a successful unpairing

- **Unpair can come back for a short while after a successful unpairing** (found in C103's review,
  read, not run). The server calls a Bluetooth device paired while the agent's last "paired" report
  is fresh (`isListed(pairedAt)`, `apps/server/src/print-api.ts`: 45 seconds while a discovery
  window is open, 15 otherwise), and a later report that the device is no longer paired keeps the
  old `pairedAt`. So for up to that long after an Unpair a device can read as paired again. Clearing
  `pairedAt` when the agent reports a successful unpair, or reports the device unpaired, would end
  it; the owner was asked (questions.md, C103).

## An agent compares the server's discovery deadline with its own clock

- **An agent compares the server's discovery deadline with its own clock** (found in C102, read, not
  run). `discoveryUntil` is a time on the server's clock, and the agent checks it against
  `host.now()` (`packages/print-agent/src/agent.ts`), where a network probe's deadline is sent as a
  duration because the two clocks can differ. An agent on another machine whose clock is out by
  minutes scans for the wrong span; one on the box shares its clock.

## `runAgentOnce` (`packages/printing/src/runtime.ts`) has no caller in the tree outside its own package's tests

- **`runAgentOnce` (`packages/printing/src/runtime.ts`) has no caller in the tree outside its own
  package's tests** (C70, #866). A
  refused report still rolls back every job of its batch when the caller's transaction rolls back,
  so all of them print again (measured 2026-09-29 with a scratch probe). A process that holds the
  venue database and runs the agent itself, and wants to confine a refused report, should call
  `claimPrintJobs` and then `reportPrintJob` per job, each report in its own transaction, as
  `apps/server/src/print-api.ts` already does, rather than one `runAgentOnce` in one transaction.
