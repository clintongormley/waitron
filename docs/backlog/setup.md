# The setup wizard, onboarding and the demo venue — detail

The open entries are listed in [the backlog](../backlog.md), under "The setup wizard, onboarding and the demo venue". This file holds
their full text.

## `#onGoto` in `setup-app.ts` keeps `fiscalTestStatus`

- `apps/setup` code, found by #567. `#onGoto` in `setup-app.ts` keeps `fiscalTestStatus`, so a
  rejected or uncertain fiscal-test banner, and an accepted result, survive leaving that screen and
  coming back, even after the certificate changes (found by reading, not run; whether that is
  wanted is undecided); a cloud restore opens the provisioning screen (`#onCloudRestoreAction`)
  without `#clearProvisionOutcome()`, which the four other ways onto that screen call first, so an
  earlier attempt's message could show there (found by reading, not run); `AdoptOutcome`'s
  `breakGlassSecret` is typed as required, but a replayed adopt answers without it
  (`apps/server/src/setup-api.ts`); the done screen treats a non-network status refusal as ready, so an HTTP 503
  can announce "The server is ready" early (A324 synthetic 503 probe through the real
  `SetupApi`, 2026-10-07; the polling rule is unchanged); the mode screen's own text says a live
  server files real invoices, which a live run on a development box does not; `setup-app.test.ts`
  has two test titles naming a `SyntaxError` from a non-JSON error body that `apiError` turns into
  `server.internal`; `events.test.ts` has no case for the restore and fiscal-test dispatchers; the
  `*.css?inline` declaration in `vite-env.d.ts` is redundant (vite/client declares it);
  `vitest.config.ts` excludes `.stryker-tmp` in a package with no Stryker config; `paintCanvas` in
  `widgets/test-helpers.ts` has no accessibility suite that fails without it; and `connection-screen.ts`'s `connection-continue` event is not named `wt-*`
  and carries no `detail`.

## Decisions and deliberate limits

**DECIDED (owner, 2026-09-29): the mode screen's certificate note stays as built** (C40, #833) — it
shows only on the path where the wizard skipped the connection question, and the question is not
asked there.
