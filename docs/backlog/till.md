# The till, devices and table service — detail

The open entries are listed in [the backlog](../backlog.md), under "The till, devices and table service". This file holds
their full text.

## Split-off checks may reach the same path as a held-order edit that changes sent lines

- Found by #623 (`apps/server` part b: working-order, tabs, tables), not fixable in a
  comments-only change. Split-off checks may reach the same path as a held-order edit that
  changes sent lines (read, not run). The walk-up concurrent double-pay case in
  `working-order.pay-and-dispatch.test.ts` replays through the settled branch and never reaches
  `payWorkingOrder`'s duplicate-key catch; nothing tests two `openTab` calls racing on one table
  or concurrent rounds landing on consecutive line numbers (the sequential versions are in
  `tabs.test.ts`); nothing checks that a location or status foreign-key refusal in `tables.ts` is
  not reported as a zone fault; `setTablePlacement`'s raw read is typed `boolean | null` where the
  engine returns 1/0/null (it only tests truthiness). The SQL `--` comments inside
  `listTablesWithState`'s template text still carry "measured 2026-09-22", PostgreSQL's "LATERAL
  form" and aggregate-pair history and a "KDS-1 §3d" pointer. "A line with no course fires
  earliest", which #623 cut from `working-order.ts` because a line sent with `hold: true` is held
  whatever its course, is still in `apps/server/src/kitchen.ts:264` and four
  `packages/db/src/schema` files (`catalogue.ts`, `kitchen-courses.ts`, `ticket-items.ts`,
  `orders.ts`). Stale test titles: "lists the node's open orders" in `working-order.test.ts`;
  "(Task B1, …)" in `working-order.pay-and-dispatch.test.ts`; "an UNLOCKED read" in
  `tabs.test.ts`; "recordSale UNCHANGED" in `tabs.filing.test.ts`; many "(KDS-…)" and
  "(A1)"-style plan tags.

## "resets any leftover drill/active tab on login" still passes with login's own clearing line deleted

- Found by #621 (the rest of `apps/till`), not fixable in a comments-only change.
  The review reported that "resets any
  leftover drill/active tab on login" still passes with login's own clearing line deleted, because
  logout clears the same state first (run in review, not re-run here). A question the prune moved
  here from a deleted `menu-filter.ts` comment: should the `no-meat`/`no-fish` lenses also hide a
  dish whose diet is still pending review, as `vegan`/`vegetarian` do? Today they hide only dishes
  known to contain the tag. Comments inside `till-app.ts`'s template text still carry design-doc
  pointers (`cash-drawer-authorization §5`, `device-enrolment §3.1`), and many `till-app.test.ts`
  titles carry plan and review labels ("(Finding 2)", "(P6)", "(FP-1)", "(KDS-1)", "Task 8",
  "(SP-B2.1)"), as do three `session-activity.test.ts` titles ("(C3)").

## Test titles repeat claims the branch corrected (#618)

- Found by #618 (`apps/till` `src/api` + `src/state` + `src/i18n`), not fixable in a
  comments-only change. Test titles repeat claims the branch corrected:
  `apps/till/src/state/working-order.test.ts` "previews the total via priceBasket" (the preview
  sums line totals) and `apps/till/src/api/client.test.ts` "getExpoQueue GETs this node's
  cross-station pass queue" (the queue is venue-wide and includes placed orders).

## Test titles repeat claims the branch corrected (#616)

- Found by #616 (`apps/till/src/widgets`), not fixable in a comments-only change. Test titles
  repeat claims the branch corrected: `apps/server/src/working-order.test.ts` "lists the node's open
  orders" (the list is venue-wide); `station-queue.test.ts` "(nothing to release)" is false for a
  held line with no course, and several `station-queue`, `tender-pay` and `modifier-picker` test
  titles carry task numbers. `css` comments in `apps/till/src/widgets/station-queue.ts` and
  `screens/till-expo-screen.ts` still call the courseless group "auto-fired". `apps/till/README.md`
  says the held list is shared across the registers "on a node". Read, not run: a courseless
  section the server held shows its lines greyed with no fire button (`#fireAction` in
  `station-queue.ts`, from #131); `GET /api/till` never sends `stripe_on_device`, so the
  offline-consent toggle cannot appear; `ReaderOption.online` is never set outside tests;
  `card-grid.ts` passes a `.canExitToCounter=${false}` that `embedded` already makes irrelevant;
  the tab shell and the supervisor dialog emit events not named `wt-*` (CLAUDE.md §3; not checked
  whether the rule reaches till widgets).

## The till always mounts the counter screen `embedded`

- Found by #614 (`apps/till/src/screens`), not fixable in a comments-only change. Read, not run:
  the till always mounts the counter screen `embedded` (`apps/till/src/till-app.ts`, the
  `<till-counter-screen>` in its render), so the screen's own header — its Allergens, Floor,
  Station, Expo, Schedule and Log out buttons and its allergen toggle — is reached only by the
  screen's own tests; the floor screen's only mount (`widgets/card-grid.ts`) passes `embedded` and
  `canExitToCounter=false`, so its standalone header, Back button and that property are likewise
  test-only; and in device mode the station screen's `#reload` swallows a `device.unauthorized`,
  so a device cookie revoked mid-session raises nothing until the next connect. The screens' `css`
  templates still carry task and spec numbers ("Task 7", "KDS-4 §3d"). Unchecked and kept: the
  allergen screen's legal citation (RD 126/2015 Art. 6.5.a.2°). Not restored because nothing
  confirms it: the table-order screen's `#lineGross` "same arithmetic the server files with" (the
  server does not call `grossOf`).

## Two `v8 ignore start` comments in `till-sale.ts` (`finalizeCapture`, `finalizeSettle`) cite `provider.ts:66-83`

- Found by #613 (`apps/server` `till-*`), outside its files or not fixable in a comments-only
  change. Two `v8 ignore start` comments in `till-sale.ts` (`finalizeCapture`,
  `finalizeSettle`) cite `provider.ts:66-83`; the checker compares tool comments character for
  character, so repointing them to `PaymentResult` in `packages/payments/src/provider.ts` is not
  a comments-only change. Test titles #613 could not touch: "lost-T2" in
  `till-sale-integrated.db.test.ts` (a captured card payment whose sale was never filed),
  "Tasks 5 & 6", "7b", "FP-1, Task 6", "FP-2, Task 4", "SP-A.2 cutover", "Task 12 cutover",
  "KDS-2/3" and "(Copilot)" in the `till-api*` and `till-config` suites, and 29 titles
  saying "opaque 500".

## A table with no shape is drawn as a rectangle and saved as round on its first edit

- Found by #604 (`packages/ui`), not fixable in a comments-only change. **A table with no shape
  is drawn as a rectangle and saved as round on its first edit**: `wt-table-token.ts` draws
  `shape-${t.shape ?? "rect"}`, while `wt-floor-canvas.ts` marks Round as pressed and sends
  `shape: t.shape ?? "round"` from `#placementOf`, so dragging, nudging or rotating a shapeless
  table changes it (read from the code, not run). `packages/ui/brand/README.md`'s table omits
  `public/icon-192.png` and `public/icon-512.png`, which the generator writes.
  `packages/ui/vitest.config.ts` and `stryker.config.json` still exclude
  `src/tokens/token-test-helpers.ts`, which moved to `packages/ui-core` in #519 (the
  entry "`packages/ui/src/vitest-park-pointer.ts` is mutated and has no tests" in Track C still
  names it there too). A reviewer believes the `demo/**` coverage exclusion matches nothing and
  that `**/ui-core/**` is there because `packages/ui-core` starts with `packages/ui` (CLAUDE.md
  §4's unanchored-include trap); neither was tested.

## Seating a booking at a table in a zone that is not a table-tab zone has no bookings test

- `packages/bookings`, found by #574 and not changed (code, not comments). Seating a booking at a
  table in a zone that is not a table-tab zone has no bookings test: the real `openTab` refuses
  it with `service_zone.mode_incompatible`, the fake core in `src/testing/fake-core.ts` does not,
  and `routes.ts`'s `STATUS` map has no entry for that code, so it answers 400 by default.
  Editing a booking that is already seated answers `booking.not_found`, which the dashboard shows
  as "could not be found". The server accepts an empty contact name; only the dashboard form
  refuses one. `seatBooking`'s `status = 'booked'` condition on its final update cannot fire
  while every caller goes through `withTransaction` (read, not run). Test titles in
  `bookings.test.ts` and `migrations.test.ts` still say "tenant", and `floor.test.ts` inserts
  `booking_time` as `HH:MM` while the write path stores `HH:MM:SS`. #574 moved the Vitest 3
  `groupOrder` measurement on bookings (CLAUDE.md §4) out of its `vitest.config.ts` into its
  commit message; `docs/developers/testing-guide.md` has no paragraph holding it.
